Idea is to create a generic suite of contracts to construct some marketplace.

We will apply these contracts to build a marketplace for UCSD, where students can buy food or groceries through vendors via our marketplace.

Three party system: merchants, "governing" body, participants

Roles:
// Governing Bodies


// Merchants


// Participants


Flow:
Governing bodies establish their own decentralized economic ecosystem by deploying the contracts. Merchants can then register and list their products for participants to purchase.

// Merchant onboarding
1. Merchants are approved by governing body prior to registration
    1. Merchants accounts are managed internally by the contract
2. Merchants are approved by governing body at request (requires some sort of onboarding for merchant)
    1. Merchants have account established prior, and are whitelisted by account address
        1. Merchants have direct access to funds in their wallet

1. Merchants have access to funds managed by treasury

3. Merchants can create and en(dis)able product listings
    1. Platform and transaction fee are automatically withdrawn
        1. Merchants are automatically paid out
            1. Merchant can declare multiple addresses earning %
        2. Funds flow into treasury

// Participant onboarding
1. Participants sign up
    1. using a custodial wallet with a domain-whitelisted email
    2. using their existing wallet address

2. Participants purchase listing
